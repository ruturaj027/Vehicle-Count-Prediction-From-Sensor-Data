# Vehicle-Count-Prediction-From-Sensor-Data
This project applies machine learning techniques to predict vehicle counts based on time-related features extracted from sensor data. Using Python (pandas, scikit-learn) and Random Forest Regressor, the model learns patterns from historical traffic data and makes predictions for future timestamps.
